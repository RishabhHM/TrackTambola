# TrackTambola
A very simple Python program to help you keep track of your Tambola Game for You. It is a real-life example of how programming can help us out in our everday affairs.

## Inspiration
I had written this code a month or two after the COVID-19 pandemic found its way in India. To keep ourselves occupied during the Lockdown, we, as in me and my neighbours, started playing online Tambola. 3-5 tickets were distributed to each player (I know it's a lot but that's what made it fun :) ). Soon enough it became tiresome and confusing to keep a track of the game while also tyring to interact with everyone. To make myself comfortable, I wrote down this simple program which helped me track my game while I continued interacting and communicating with my fellow neighbours.
